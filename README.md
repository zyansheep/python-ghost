# Ghost the word game (in python)

## How to Play
Pick the number of players playing (minimum 2) and then take turn typing letters. Every time you type a letter, you must have a word in mind that starts with the current buffer of letters.

See: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game)) for better explanation.

# Usage
Must use python version 3
```bash
python ghost.py dictionary.txt
```
